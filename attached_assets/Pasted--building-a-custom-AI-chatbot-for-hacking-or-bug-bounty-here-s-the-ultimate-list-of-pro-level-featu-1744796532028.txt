 building a custom AI chatbot for hacking or bug bounty, here's the ultimate list of pro-level features it could have to help you hack like an elite professional:
üß† CORE INTELLIGENCE FEATURES
1. Payload Generation

    Auto-generate payloads for:

        XSS (reflected, stored, DOM)

        SQLi (error-based, blind, time-based)

        SSTI (Jinja2, Flask, Twig)

        Command Injection, LFI, RCE

        JWT brute-forcing / manipulation

    Obfuscate payloads to bypass filters

    Encode/Decode (URL, base64, hex, Unicode, HTML entities)

2. Smart Recon Assistant

    Give it a domain and it:

        Suggests tools & commands (subfinder, amass, etc.)

        Uses passive & active recon logic

        Parses ASN, DNS, WHOIS, cert transparency, IP ranges

        Finds associated GitHub repos, S3 buckets, subdomains

        Identifies tech stack and vulnerabilities using Wappalyzer & Nuclei templates

3. Live Request Analyzer

    Paste HTTP request/response ‚Üí chatbot identifies:

        Potential injection points

        Missing security headers

        Auth issues (tokens, cookies, session handling)

        CSRF, CORS, CSP misconfigs

4. Vulnerability Explainer

    Explains:

        What a specific vuln is

        Why it happens

        How to exploit it

        How to escalate (e.g., SSRF ‚Üí RCE)

    Converts HackerOne report writeups into simplified strategies

5. Tool Integration via CLI

    Chatbot can run:

        ffuf for directory bruteforce

        nmap / rustscan for port scanning

        httpx for live hosts

        nuclei for vuln templates

        waybackurls or gau for archived endpoints

        gf patterns to find common vuln parameters

6. Exploit Chain Designer

    You paste recon findings ‚Üí bot suggests full exploit path:

        Open redirect ‚Üí SSRF ‚Üí Metadata exposure ‚Üí RCE

        Suggests what to test next

        Chain vulns into privesc or data exfil

7. AI-Enhanced Wordlists

    Custom wordlist generation based on:

        URLs

        Parameters

        Tech stack

        Common endpoint patterns for APIs, mobile apps, etc.

8. Bypass Generator

    Create WAF/EDR bypasses for:

        XSS filters

        SQLi WAF rules

        Content Security Policy

        File upload filters

    Escapes & alternate encodings

9. Post-Exploitation Help

    Shell cheat sheets for Linux/Windows/macOS

    Reverse shell generator (bash, Python, PowerShell, PHP, etc.)

    Web shell uploader

    Local privilege escalation ideas based on OS info
